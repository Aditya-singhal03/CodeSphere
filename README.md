# CodeSphere - A Full-Stack MERN Coding Platform with Secure Code Execution using Docker and Efficient Asynchronous Communication with RabbitMQ.
CodeSphere is a feature-rich Full-Stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) Coding Platform designed to enhance the coding experience for users. It offers a range of functionalities to cater to developers of all levels.

## Key Features

1. **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login system using *JSON Web Tokens* (JWT) to protect user data and provide a personalized coding experience.

2. **Admin Panel:** A dedicated admin panel to manage and add coding problems, enabling seamless content updates. Admin can add Test cases separately.

3. **Code Execution with Docker:** CodeSphere employs containerization using *Docker* to execute user code securely, preventing any potential harm to the server.

4. **Asynchronous Communication with RabbitMQ:** Leveraging *RabbitMQ*, the platform enables efficient and scalable asynchronous communication for better responsiveness and improved user experience.
   
5. **Real-time Code Evaluation:** Instant feedback on code correctness and performance, promoting a learn-by-doing approach.

6. **Feedback Quality:** To ensure an accurate evaluation, user code is executed within a secure containerized environment. The feedback generated includes multiple possibilities such as *"Accepted"* for correct solutions, *"Wrong Answer"* for incorrect outputs, *"Compilation Error"* for code that fails to compile, *"Time Limit Exceeded"* for code that takes too long to execute, and *"Run-time Error"* for code that encounters errors during execution. This comprehensive feedback allows users to identify and rectify errors, promoting a robust learning experience.

7. **Submission History:** Access past code submissions and their evaluation results for review and learning purposes.

8. **Problem-Solving:** Users can access a wide range of coding problems, Each coding question has a clear description with all necessary sections like Description, Input Specification, Output Specification, and Test Cases.
